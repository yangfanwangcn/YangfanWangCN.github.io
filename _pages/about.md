I am going to obtain my Master degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), China, in 2026. My research is supervised by Prof. [Xuefei Zhang](https://sice.bupt.edu.cn/info/1092/2021.htm). Prior to this, I completed my B.E. degree at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2023, under the guidance of Prof. Yan Ming.

My research is primarily centered around **the utilizationof Semantic Communication (SemComm) in Immersive Communication**. Our key objective is to explore <font color=green>"how to utilize SemComm to help Immersive Communication achieve efficient, reliable, and secure performance"</font>. This involves exploring and integration from the application layer to the physical layer, including Semantic Communication, Wireless Channels, Resource Allocation, Transmission Scheduling, Semantic security, and the Metaverse.

Currently, I am participating in research in the [Wireless Technology Innovation@WTI](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NjUxMzMzMw==&mid=2247484097&idx=1&sn=c32aea9ed3b76f51e92dd251ca0568c2&chksm=ce48fa1bf93f730d5787b792837e644e0f1e274c0f7c9acad05d84ae25bb14b3628036ac7475&scene=18#wechat_redirect) [(WeChat public account QR code)](/images/BUPT_WTI.jpg) , which is a team led by Fellow [Zhang Ping](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/info/1070/83435.htm) and Professor [Tao Xiaofeng](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/1222.htm).

**If you are interested to collaborate with me or just want to chat**, feel free to email me (wangyangfan@bupt.edu.cn) !

I am always happy to discuss or learn content from different fields with everyone! Especially at this stage, I have been engaged in research in this field for just over a year, and I hope to broaden and deepen my knowledge in this field and other related areas. I look forward to making progress with everyone and jointly promoting the development of academic research.
